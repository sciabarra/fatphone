FatPhone is an Open Source iPhone web site for Fatwire Content Server.

Please check  our blog http://www.sciabarra.com/fatwire for more information.

# Prerequisites

You need, of course, Fatwire Content Server (I tested against the JumpStart 7.5.2)

* Create a new site in FatWire named  *FatPhone* (mandatory)

* Create a new flex family in FatWire named *FatPhone* with:

<table>
  <tr><th>Attribute</th><td>fp_A</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Content Definition</th><td>fp_CD</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Parent Definition</th><td>fp_PD</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Content</th><td>fp_C</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Parent</th><td>fp_P</td></tr>
  <tr><th>Filter</th><td>fp_F</td></tr>
</table>

* Enable for the site:
  - Page
  - Template
  - CSElement
  - AttrTypes
  - fp_A
  - fp_CD
  - fp_PC
  - fp_C
  - fp_P

# Deployment

NOTE: be careful that your application server  do NOT interpret *.jspf under /fp as JSP files but as simple text files.

* Copy all the content of folder fp as static content and be sure that it is accessible as  http://yoursite/fp/

If you have apache, put fp in the root folder of your apache installation.
If you have just tomcat, put fp under the ROOT folder of your tomcat webapps directory.
If you have something else... well your mileage may vary.

* Call http://yoursite/fp/install.html, then 

  * specify the correct access credentials, then click "Login"
  * click on "All Elements" then "Install Elements" 
  * click on "All Assets" then "Install Assets"
  * optionally click on "All Samples" then "Install Samples"
 
# Final Notes

The installer install only the assets and optionally some sample content. 
You have now to create the site plan:
 * create and organize pages as a hierarchy
 * create and place content (fp_C assets with subtype fpMultiText, currently) as children of pages, to reach them with the navigation

There is now a shortcut to easily open the home page. 
Selecting http://yoursite/fp/index.html  (or just /fp if index.html is the default index) it will redirect and load the page fpHome.
The home page will be blank however unless you place content as children and organize the siteplan
